push() and unshift() are methods that add an element to an array. The only difference is that unshif() adds the 
element to the beginning of the array, and push() adds it to the end. Unshift() is slower because it has to move all the 
elements of the array by one, but from the test results it seems like unshift is more scalable. 
So like with everything in software engineering, whichever method you use will depend on the situation.
